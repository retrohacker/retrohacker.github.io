    <h1>Tactical Privacy</h1>

    <p><i>Originally written for Every Two Years</i></p>

    <p>
      In 2013, an NSA contractor leaked an internal review of project
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_Wind">Stellar Wind</a>,
      also known as the President’s Surveillance Program (PSP). This project,
      and its successors, have been the focus of at least two public hearings
      from the Senate Intelligence Committee - in
      <a
        href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/hearings/open-hearing-fisa-legislation"
        >2013</a
      >
      and
      <a
        href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/hearings/open-hearing-fisa-legislation-0"
        >2017</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Write-ups of these leaks, and the Senate hearings covering them, have
      given us a rare inside look into how the government conducts warrantless
      domestic surveillance. There are many articles covering general privacy
      and security. This article is focused on protecting you from what we know
      of warrantless domestic surveillance.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want some background information on how we believe the government’s
      mass surveillance program works, and why we recommend what we recommend,
      read on. Otherwise <a href="#summary">click here</a> to jump straight to
      our recommendations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Distinguishing between a government official without a warrant and one
      with a warrant is important, as we believe the two have different levels
      of access to your personal data.
    </p>

    <p>
      When documents for the PSP were thrust into the light of day in 2013, we
      learned something valuable as citizens: our government was
      <em>trying</em> to follow the law. Granted
      <a href="https://www.aaup.org/brief/aclu-v-nsa-493-f3d-644-6th-cir-2007"
        >courts have ruled</a
      >
      the program was illegal, the vice president’s lawyer drafted an
      interpretation of the law arguing the program was legal. It appears the
      NSA invested great effort in trying to stay within that interpretation of
      the law. In other words, the government might <em>really</em> stretch the
      law when it comes to surveillance but they still try to follow it.
    </p>

    <h2 id="stretching-the-law">Stretching The Law</h2>

    <p>So they are watching us without a warrant. How is that legal?</p>

    <p>
      The first Senate Intelligence Committee hearing showed us part of the
      legal theory they were using to justify the program:
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_v._Maryland"
        >Smith vs. Maryland 442 U.S. 735 (1979)</a
      >. Michael Lee Smith had robbed someone and was repeatedly threatening
      them over the phone. The police, having identified Smith as a suspect,
      installed a “bug” at the phone company which would record the phone
      numbers Smith dialed catching him making the threatening call. They did
      not get a warrant to do this.
    </p>

    <p>
      Smith’s lawyers argued this constituted a warrantless search. They took it
      all the way to the Supreme Court. The verdict? Smith didn’t have a
      reasonable expectation of privacy when he dialed the phone number. The
      phone number was being shared with the phone company who is known to
      record the numbers customers dial for billing purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      To justify mass surveillance, the government argued that “metadata” (more
      on this term later) has no reasonable expectation of privacy. If Smith vs.
      Maryland applies to any one person then it applies to everyone all at
      once. If you can record the phone number a single person dials then you
      can also record all of the phone numbers all of your citizens dial.
    </p>

    <h2 id="metadata">Metadata</h2>

    <p>
      A central point in the government’s mass surveillance program is
      distinguishing between “content” and “metadata”. Content is the
      <em>actual</em> communication, like Smith’s voice in a phone call.
      Metadata is information <em>about</em> a communication; the phone number
      Smith dialed. For example, when we send a letter in the mail, we could
      call everything inside the envelope “content”; the mailing address, return
      address, weight, date sent, date received, postage paid, who paid the
      postage, etc. could be called “metadata”.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you make a phone call, view a website, or send an email, you leave a
      trail of metadata about that communication. Your electronic devices
      frequently communicate on your behalf, without any interaction from you,
      leaving a trail of metadata. The government believes they have a right to
      record and search that metadata without needing a warrant.
    </p>

    <p>
      The
      <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/why-metadata-matters">EFF</a> is on
      point when describing the problem of not applying the 4th amendment to
      communication metadata:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        They know you called the suicide prevention hotline from the Golden Gate
        Bridge. But the topic of the call remains a secret.
      </p>

      <p>
        They know you got an email from an HIV testing service, then called your
        doctor, then visited an HIV support group website in the same hour. But
        they don’t know what was in the email or what you talked about on the
        phone.
      </p>

      <p>
        They know you received an email from a digital rights activist group
        with the subject line “Let’s Tell Congress: Stop SESTA/FOSTA” and then
        called your elected representative immediately after. But the content of
        those communications remains safe from government intrusion.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This is where it is critical to differentiate between warrantless
      surveillance and targeted surveillance with a warrant. If you believe the
      government has a warrant to search the content of your communication, then
      this blog post isn’t going to help you. If your goal is to avoid passive
      warrantless searches, to keep your communication metadata from being
      stored in a government database, this blog post is going to walk you
      through the tools you can use and why we believe they work.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let’s take a look at some common stuff people do with tech, and the small
      changes you can make to prevent your data from ending up in the
      government’s mass surveillance databases.
    </p>

    <h2 id="using-the-internet">Using The Internet</h2>

    <p>
      Most of our communication today happens over the public internet. Instead
      of phone calls and text messages, we use video chat and messenger apps. In
      addition to the metadata generated by the messages we send, the Internet’s
      protocol generates a bunch of metadata as well: what servers your devices
      connect to, how much data you exchange, how frequently you visit, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      Much of this metadata centers around connecting to computers and involves
      something you may have heard of before: an IP address (short for
      internet-protocol). When you buy internet from your cable provider or cell
      phone carrier, they assign you an ip address for connecting to the
      internet - a random looking collection of numbers and dots that looks
      something like: 24.56.20.230. This IP address is like a mailing address.
      The government records this metadata in a database, keeping track of what
      IP address talked to what IP address, in the same way they may keep track
      of the sender/recipient of a letter sent via the mail.
    </p>

    <p>
      This means that, from the moment we connect to the internet, the
      government can keep a record of everything we do. To avoid warrantless
      tracking, we recommend using a VPN. A VPN can obscure your IP Address by
      allowing your device to connect to the internet through their servers.
      This means the government will only be able to see that you connected to
      the VPN but won’t be able to see what you did through that connection
      without advanced traffic analysis. While a VPN can protect you from
      surveillance, it’s important to choose your VPN provider carefully since
      you’ll be sharing all of your internet activity with them. We trust
      <a href="https://mullvad.net">Mullvad</a> for this. Mullvad is the company
      providing the servers for
      <a href="https://vpn.mozilla.org/">Mozilla’s VPN</a> and has a
      <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/help/no-logging-data-policy/"
        >no-nonsense privacy policy</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mullvad does some important things that make it the front-running pick for
      a VPN provider. First, they don’t use user accounts. They generate a
      random account number for you. There is no way for Mullvad to tell who
      owns what account. You can put money and your account number in an
      envelope without a return address and send it to them. Of course, you can
      also pay with a credit card which will associate you with the account.
      Next, they keep no logs of connections and they only use the bare minimum
      amount of metadata necessary to route and authenticate requests. Finally,
      for advanced users, Mullvad supports “multi-hop” connections, meaning your
      communication is routed through multiple servers before reaching the
      internet.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe using a VPN provider like Mullvad will help keep your personal
      internet metadata out of government databases.
    </p>

    <h2 id="messaging">Messaging</h2>

    <p>
      If you are wanting to communicate with one or more people, many people
      reach for text messaging, social media messengers, or email. Instead, we
      recommend <a href="https://www.signal.org/">Signal</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your email can be read by anyone with access to the network between you
      and the recipient, including all metadata about the communication. Text
      messages share all routing information (like phone numbers associated with
      a text) with the telecom provider. From what we know of government mass
      surveillance, the government is storing this metadata (email recipient,
      sender, timestamp, subject line, etc.) in a database. Similarly, they are
      storing text message metadata as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Signal, in contrast, takes great care to limit what data you share
      publicly when messaging folks. They’ve developed some state-of-the-art
      tech that allows for messages to be sent with very little metadata being
      generated. In fact, Signal uses a technique known as “sealed sender”,
      meaning it’s not possible to tell who is communicating with who on the
      Signal network. From what we know of government bulk metadata collection,
      your messages sent on the Signal network will be safe from the program.
    </p>

    <h2 id="web-browsing">Web Browsing</h2>

    <p>
      When browsing the web, and interacting with this technology, you generate
      a <em>massive</em> amount of metadata that the government can scoop up
      into a database.
    </p>

    <p>
      We strongly recommend using
      <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> which is
      run by a security focused non-profit. By default, Firefox ships with a
      feature called DNS over HTTPS. DNS, or domain name service, is what takes
      a web address like “evertwoyears.org” and translates it into one of those
      IP addresses we talked about before. When you type a web address into a
      browser, your computer generates a DNS request that the government can
      store. Firefox encrypts this traffic, and resolves it using
      <a href="https://1.1.1.1/">CloudFlare</a>, which we believe keeps it out
      of government databases.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you have Firefox Installed, we recommend installing
      <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/https-everywhere/"
        >HTTPS Everywhere</a
      >, a plugin that forces websites to encrypt all traffic you send. HTTP is
      the language web browsers speak when they download websites. HTTP doesn’t
      have any protections, so just like email, anybody who has access to the
      network between you and the website you are viewing can see everything you
      do. HTTPS on the other hand encrypts almost everything. This is important
      because, like email having a “subject” line, HTTP has “headers” which
      <em>could</em> be considered metadata by the government. Headers can
      contain some pretty sensitive content. We believe that using HTTPS
      Everywhere will keep these headers out of government databases.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, we recommend installing
      <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/"
        >uBlock Origin</a
      >
      and
      <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/"
        >Privacy Badger</a
      >. Many advertising networks rely on a process known as “<a
        href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/about#browser-fingerprinting"
        >fingerprinting</a
      >
      “ to identify you and track what websites you visit. While these
      fingerprinting techniques are often derived from the content of a
      communication, which we believe would require a warrant for the government
      to view, it’s not clear whether the government would consider the
      fingerprint report sent back to the advertiser as “metadata” once
      generated.
    </p>

    <h2 id="cellphone">Cellphone</h2>

    <p>
      We have some bad news. Questions asked during a 2013 Senate Hearing
      indicate the government considers a cellphone’s location as “metadata”. To
      understand how this happened, remember back to the beginning of this post
      when we said your devices communicate with no interaction from you? Your
      cellphone is frequently talking to nearby cellphone towers letting them
      know approximately where the phone is. This is necessary for your phone to
      work but, unfortunately, it seems the government believes they have a
      right U.S. citizens location data without a warrant. We don’t have a good
      everyday solution for this. If you are doing something sensitive, like
      peacefully assembling at a rally or protest, we will share some tactics
      for protecting yourself in a future blog post. But these tactics aren’t
      practical for everyday use.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

    <p>
      A common myth is that the government is watching everything all the time.
      We don’t believe they are. We believe that, without a warrant, there is
      only a limited amount of spying the government will conduct on U.S.
      citizens, and this spying is limited to metadata about a communication. To
      try and shield yourself from warrantless searches of your metadata, we
      recommend the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Do <strong>NOT</strong> use email</li>
      <li>Do <strong>NOT</strong> use text messaging</li>
      <li>Do <strong>NOT</strong> use social media messengers</li>
      <li>Do use <a href="https://www.signal.org/">Signal</a></li>
      <li>
        Do use <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>
      </li>
      <li>
