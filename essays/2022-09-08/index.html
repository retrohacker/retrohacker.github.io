    <h1>GraphQL Mental Models</h1>
    <p>
      I help organizations adopt GraphQL. The most demanding part of these
      projects is getting cross-functional alignment to drive schema design. I
      have found myself needing to craft messaging that would quickly bring
      teams up to speed on the problem we were solving and how GraphQL would fit
      into their roadmaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      After going through this exercise, I suspect my situation isn't unique.
      GraphQL is still a nascent technology. Bringing it into an organization,
      you may find many who've heard of it in name only. I'm documenting the
      mental models I've used to quickly "upload" context to other folks to
      prime conversations around GraphQL; maybe these will help you too!
    </p>
    <h2>Mental Model 1: GraphQL as a Server API</h2>
    <aside>
      This mental model helps frame the problem we are solving. It is most
      useful when presenting to a large technical organization ahead of demoing
      a schema through something like GraphiQL or voyager.
    </aside>
    <p>
      How did we as an industry end up at GraphQL? Why did multiple companies
      come up with similar solutions around the same time (i.e. Netflix's
      Falcor)? Let's take a quick (super oversimplified) look at the series of
      events that brought us here.
    </p>
    <p>
      GraphQL has its roots in the application web, not the document web. When
      we started to explore delivering application experiences through a web
      browser (the early days between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0), we usually had a 1:1
      mapping between views and backend endpoints. You'd reach out to the
      <code class="inline">/home</code> endpoint then a CGI script would handle
      fetching all of the data needed to hydrate the UI and return it all in one
      response. Not only would it return the data, but it would also fully
      hydrate the UI for you and return the final HTML payload.
    </p>
    <img

      height="474px"

    />
    <img
      width="851px"
      height="169px"
      src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTIg6udWGc-T_vPA5ruYRXb7bZhH55bJUYO7-co_lVTYV3Bkr_O1_W88PGH48Q_onfD0diTRsa0kqDJ/pub?w=851&amp;h=169"
    />
    <p>
      The number of views in an application started growing rapidly. We had
      multiple user personas, each persona had many states, and we had to
      support an ever-growing variety of devices. Not to mention we wanted to
      share the same APIs across native applications and our Web 2.0
      applications!
    </p>
    <p>
      To scale development, we broke the UI up into components. A view became a
      collection of components. Similarly, the backend server was broken up into
      separate endpoints that exposed portions of the application's data model.
      Using something like AJAX, the page would kick off a series of requests to
      the backend server to fetch data that would be used to hydrate these
      components.
    </p>
    <img
      width="1046px"
      height="474px"
      src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTO16padth3kfNk56Up8UXeI8pNfEqUmtelMAc-7Tmw5hpHCx_e5z4VHquI2WKmkPYGL_wogXEdgAeE/pub?w=1046&amp;h=474"

    />
    <p>
      As organizations scaled to build applications on the web, oftentimes team
      boundaries would be drawn between the UI and the server API. This means
      the same engineer wouldn't be working on both the backend API and a UI
      component. Hidden in this multi-team relationship are two constraints that
      are difficult to reconcile.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the one hand, the backend team has been tasked with building endpoints
      that are specific enough to meet the UI's needs without wasting resources
      like processing time and bandwidth. On the other hand, the backend team
      has been tasked with building an API that is generic enough to support the
      entirety of the current UI along with much of its future innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your API is too generic, you are going to waste both server and client
      resources by sending large responses back to the client. This will eat up
      your customer's data on mobile connections, slow down the user experience,
      and increase hosting costs. We call this "over fetching." If your API is
      too specific, every change to the UI is going to require one or more
      corresponding changes to the API. Get that wrong and your team is going to
      be unpopular for slowing the company down.
    </p>
    <img
      width="1046px"
      height="474px"
      src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTcmvyNufVtwNG14OrVyeZPMQtPxzad_xVZO0a56E2C2qjq6de8__Ml1tGPW0RVPMyfMK6P0HEfWPUQ/pub?w=1046&amp;h=474"

    />
    <p>
      To solve this, what we are trying to do is go back to where we started: a
      single endpoint that can hydrate a webpage. But our needs have changed.
      Our applications no longer need a fully hydrated HTML payload from the
      server. Our views are made up of components, each of which has its own
      data needs. Some of these components may already be hydrated from previous
      views. We want an endpoint that is simultaneously generic enough to
      support most UI innovation with little-to-no backend changes while
      specific enough to deliver exactly what the UI needs when it needs it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is GraphQL. And, instead of an endpoint per view, we get one endpoint
      to rule them all!
    </p>
    <h2>Mental Model 2: GraphQL as a Database-like Gateway</h2>
    <aside>
      This mental model helps us think about schema design. It is most useful
      when engaging with backend API teams trying to understand how their
      existing data models will compose with GraphQL. It is also helpful when
      working with UI teams to guide data modeling exercises.
    </aside>
    <p>
      We want to empower UI teams to self-service most of their data needs
      without being blocked by backend engineering work. One way to let clients
      fully service their own data needs is to give them direct access to a
      database. When our API is a database, instead of worrying about each query
      a client makes, we focus on modeling and optimizing the data the client
      will need, securing data access, and adding safe guards ensuring clients
      can't overwhelm the database with queries. Clients are free to query that
      data however they like and only need to loop in backend engineers when the
      database models are insufficient or their queries are slow. So why don't
      most projects do this?
    </p>
    <p>You might remember this diagram from the previous section:</p>
    <img
      src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vSdQurrPbNHHMEXYmFkLrDHsPS-URKa6YKokvGuaUQMJOeQkHVULitzTi-2KRFkHc4-AHfQNblVBVbF/pub?w=851&amp;h=169"
    />
    <p>
      For most companies, this diagram is oversimplified. In reality, there is a
      whole lot of infrastructure and business logic sitting between your
      company's gateway servers and the backend databases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pushing all of that business logic to the client isn't practical. It
      increases the complexity of the clients, forces every device team to
      re-implement (or find a way to share) that logic between their
      applications, and there are cases where the client can't be trusted with
      business logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      What we want is a database-like API on top of our backend infrastructure.
      This keeps the business logic server-side while allowing clients to query
      the servers as if they were a database. This is what GraphQL gives us.
      Like our REST API, the GraphQL server acts as a Gateway routing requests
      to many backend services. True to its namesake, GraphQL exposes the data
      from backend services as a directed graph that can be queried using a
      query language. Instead of focusing on endpoints, our backend teams focus
      on providing the right data models and access controls for client teams to
      query what they need.
    </p>
    <p>Let's take a look at an example GraphQL schema:</p>
    <img
      width="928px"
      height="201px"
      src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vSPDrXWEUdMNSLlyop8D8vOOUdfnIplsmzp-jj2nqKGndf3SGjvs21C35DXJ3HQ_scX65L4g0RbX2ks/pub?w=928&h=201"
    />
    <p>
      The types <code class="inline language-plaintext">Post</code>,<code
        class="inline language-plaintext"
        >Comment</code
      >, and <code class="inline language-plaintext">User</code> look like SQL
      Tables and the connections between them look like joins. With REST, the UI
      team is responsible for doing client-side joins across multiple backend
      endpoints. GraphQL supports multi-service joins natively abstracting this
      away from UI teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Multi-service joins are useful to backend teams too. In REST, your service
      is expected to return all of the context a client needs to make sense of
      your data; your endpoint is expected to stand on its own. In GraphQL, your
      service's data is associated with other services' data through connections
      in the graph. The user service doesn't need to return data about posts or
      comments. At most, services need to track the "primary keys" that will
      allow GraphQL to associate data between services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joins also give you the ability to extend and enrich data returned from
      other services with application specific data. For example, an Admin
      service could extend the
      <code class="inline language-plaintext">Post</code> type with fields only
      relevant to administrative users; GraphQL will handle stitching it
      together in the schema.
    </p>
    <h2>Mental Model 3: GraphQL as a REST Server</h2>
    <aside>
      I've found this mental model helps us reason about the surface area a
      GraphQL API exposes. It has been useful for conversations with InfoSec and
      backend engineers who are already familiar with securing REST APIs.
    </aside>
    <p>
      Query and Mutation fields are similar to GET and POST/PUT requests. The
      query <code class="inline">getPosts(userId:string)</code> translates
      fairly well to <code class="inline">GET /posts/${userId}/</code>. You pass
      in some query parameters and get a response back out. At this point, there
      is little value in using GraphQL over REST.
    </p>
    <p>A GraphQL request can contain multiple queries. For example:</p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-graphql">
query {
  getPosts(userId:string)
  getProfilePicture(userId:string)
  getNotifications()
}
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      This lets you send a single request over the wire and get back multiple
      payloads. This is similar to issuing three GET requests using HTTP
      pipelining. At this point, there is little value in using GraphQL instead
      of REST over a pipelined connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we have something roughly equivalent to a REST API sending responses
      over a pipelined HTTP connection. But what if the client doesn't need the
      full response? In REST, you can create query parameters that filter
      responses or add dedicated batch endpoints. But this kind of filtering
      adds significant complexity to your API and has to be done ad-hoc as use
      cases pop up. As REST APIs structured like this continue to grow, their
      query parameters start looking suspiciously like a query language bolted
      onto a REST API. In contrast, GraphQL bakes filtering in through its Query
      Language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine a use case for the
      <code class="inline">getNotifications</code> query above: you want to
      display a badge that shows the user how many notifications they have. But
      the <code class="inline">getNotifcations</code> endpoint returns the
      entire notification object (including the subject, description, timestamp,
      and various linked objects associated with the notification like posts and
      user information). If you send all of that data over the wire, the client
      is going to disregard it and just count the number of returned elements in
      the array to display the badge. Instead, with GraphQL, the client could
      issue this request:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-graphql">
query {
  getNotifications {
    id
  }
}
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      This lets the client get back a list of all the notification ids, a
      substantially smaller payload. This filtering is available to all queries
      without any additional backend engineering work.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a REST api, you might split nested objects up over separate endpoints
      to reduce the chance a client has to over-fetch to get the data they need.
      In GraphQL you can nest away; the client can tell the server it isn't
      interested in a nested object by omitting it from the query.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking about a query as a "filter" can help us reason about the surface
      area of our GraphQL API. Instead of looking at this like an SQL query with
      infinite possibilities, we invert the mental model and think instead of
      the fully expanded REST payload with a filter applied. The fully expanded
      REST payload - before filtering is applied - is our API surface area.
    </p>

      These are my mental models for GraphQL - I'm sure there is room for
      improvement. What do you think? Do these resonate with you? Do you think
