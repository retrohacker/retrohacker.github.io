    <h1>Fiat Identity and the King Problem</h1>

    <p>
      There is no sufficient threshold of evidence necessary for someone to be
      king.
    </p>

    <p>It doesn’t matter if:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>They have a meticulously documented family history</li>
      <li>
        They have a cryptographic proof signed by the gods of their ancestors
        declaring them king
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      What matters is that the right people believe they are king. The evidence
      only matters insofar as it supports the belief.
    </p>

    <h2>Proof of Being King is Unsolvable</h2>

    <p>
      If we mistake the threshold of evidence necessary for belief with evidence
      of being king, The King Problem is unsolvable.
    </p>

    <p>Not just with computers; it’s unsolvable in the real world.</p>

    <p>
      Computers have an even harder challenge when approaching The King Problem:
      most of the evidence supporting belief in the real world is not
      cryptographically verifiable. I can’t cryptographically verify your
      parents.
    </p>

    <p>
      Organizations, companies, governments, clubs, etc. are all just variations
      of The King Problem; each with varying thresholds of evidence necessary
      for proving membership to interested parties.
    </p>

    <p>
      We should not try to solve unsolvable problems. The Matrix says it best:
    </p>

    <aside>
      Do not try and bend the spoon. <br />
      That's impossible. Instead... only try to realize the truth. <br />
      There is no spoon. <br />
      Then you'll see, that it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.
      <br />

    <h2>Bending the Spoon</h2>

    <p>
      When it comes to "organizations," they are an emergent social phenomenon.
      They are the result of people waking up, going out into the world, and
      peopling at scale.
    </p>

    <p>
      We don’t need to “build organizations” in p2p systems, we just need to
      capture the relevant social interactions among interested parties in a
      provable way. If we document the social interactions, organizations will
      emerge as a feature of the system.
    </p>

    <h2>Fiat Identity</h2>

    <p>There is no such thing as a cryptographically verifiable identity.</p>

    <p>
      Shallowly, possessing Alice’s private key does not cryptographically prove
      that you are Alice any more than possessing Alice’s car key proves that
      you own Alice’s car.
    </p>

    <p>
      More fundamentally, trying to prove that I’m Alice is meaningless because
      “Alice” is meaningless as a designator. What we want to prove is not that
      Alice is Alice, but that the person I’m talking to is the person I refer
      to as Alice.
    </p>

    <p>
      When it comes to Alice being Alice there is no such thing as global
      consensus because there isn’t global knowledge of Alice. The only people
      interested in establishing the authenticity of Alice is Alice’s social
      group.
    </p>

    <p>We call these the interested parties.</p>

    <p>
      If all of the interested parties agree that Alice is Alice, then Alice is
      Alice.
    </p>

    <p>
      If all of the interested parties agree that Alice represents E-Corp within
      a scope of capabilities, then Alice represents E-Corp within a scope of
      capabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Governments exist because people say they do. Organizations exist because
      people say they do. This is Fiat Identity. We extend that into our network
      by saying “These keys belong to this real-world person because I say they
      do.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Not only is that sufficient, that’s the best we can do. We can’t
      cryptographically verify Alice’s I-9, we can only cryptographically verify
      that Bob was endowed with the authority to conduct I-9s on behalf of an
      organization and Bob attests that Alice successfully completed the I-9.
      That social interaction, Bob sitting with Alice and inspecting her
      government-issued IDs, needs to be captured in a data structure that can
      be socially and cryptographically validated. Once it is, Alice is now
      Alice within an organization.
    </p>

    <h2>Implications</h2>

    <p>
      This might seem like it is somewhere between stating the obvious and being
      pedantic, but proof-of-personhood appears to be a Holy Grail in p2p
      systems. I'm asserting that is not solvable.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm also asserting that peer-to-peer systems become easier to reason
      about, and easier to build, when you model identity as being fiat.
