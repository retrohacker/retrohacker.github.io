    <h1>Da Vinci's Paintbrush</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary_action">
        Capillary Action
      </a>
      is my favorite Wikipedia article
    </p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <p>
      When Leonardo da Vinci observed capillary action he remarked that the
      paintbrush was a gift from the gods. He correctly observed that his
      paintbrush had an unnatural affinity to paint, given human understanding
      at the time. If you place a brush in a cup of paint and come back sometime
      later, the brush will have <i>pulled</i> the paint into itself noticeably
      above the surface of the paint in the cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Da Vinci, his paintbrush was magic.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn't until the 1800s that we had the early versions of the
      Young-Laplace equation which attempted to quantitatively explain the
      phenomenon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fast forward to 1900,

        Albert Einstein's first paper
      </a>
      was still exploring Da Vinci's paintbrush.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Wikipedia entry reminds me that this world is full of magic and
      wonder if you just slow down and look. Something as simple as a paintbrush
      can reveal a quite peculiar thing that takes generations of study by the
      brightest of human minds to try and explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Go outside and turn over a rock, any rock, and there is a lifetime of
      wonder and mystery under it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, just because we can explain it now, doesn't mean Da Vinci's
      paintbrush isn't magic.
    </p>
    <p>It just means that the magic is real.</p>
