    <h1>NAT Traversal</h1>
    <aside>
      This article is written from the perspective of writing peer-to-peer
      software.
      <br />
      <br />
      I fundamentally misunderstood what NAT traversal was and how it worked, so
      I’m documenting it here for future travelers.
      <br />
      <br />
      I’m also not an expert in any of this. Portions of this may be wrong!
      <br />
      <br />
      Don’t hesitate to comment on anything that looks incorrect to you. Most of
      this is sourced from
      <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/"

      >.
    </aside>
    <h1>Packets flow in both directions</h1>
    <p>
      When writing software, we use terms like “opening a connection” or
      “sending a response and getting a reply.” In my head, when thinking about
      this from a software perspective, there is a magic tunnel where a “server”
      can send a “response” back to a “client” without the “client” having to
      run a “server.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This is an illusion, a convenient abstraction provided by the networking
      layer. Underneath that layer, a packet going to the server looks nearly
      indistinguishable from a packet going to the client, especially with UDP.
      When a client makes a request to a server it opens up a transient port to
      accept a response. It then sends a packet to the server and the server
      sends a packet back to that open port.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let that sink in, every time a client makes an outbound request, it starts
      looking like a transient server. That “server” exists for the duration of
      the “connection.”
    </p>
    <aside>
      TCP and QUIC complicate this a bit. It’s why you don’t often see NAT
      Traversal happening over those protocols and why most descriptions of NAT
      Traversal use UDP. I’m not going to pretend to understand how any of this
      applies to TCP/QUIC!
    </aside>
    <h1>Everything is a server, problem solved!</h1>
    <p>
      If clients can start transient servers, they can start long-lived servers
      too right? Actually, yes. A computer can do that, which isn’t surprising.
      But the problem is twofold:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Firewalls</li>
      <li>Network Address Translation</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Do you connect to the net? I wouldn’t if I were you! - NetWatch</h1>
    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
      <img
        style="max-width: 300px"

      />
    </div>
    <p>
      In a perfect world, software would only do the things we want it to. But
      software is less than perfect and motivated adversaries can find clever
      ways to trick software into doing undesirable things. The internet is a
      dangerous place. There are a lot of computers on it whose users don’t have
      good intentions. They’re looking for misconfigured software they can trick
      into behaving against the intentions of its operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      If every time you connected to a server, you had to start your own
      long-lived server that anyone on the internet could connect to, you’d be
      opening yourself up to quite a bit of risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is where firewalls come in. A common rule for “clients” is that their
      firewalls will only allow packets from a remote computer through if the
      client sent a packet to that address first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firewalls maintain a stateful list of all the destinations a computer has
      sent packets. If Alice sends a message to Bob, the firewall will allow Bob
      to send a message to Alice. Even though Alice has to have a public
      <code class="inline">(ip, port)</code> open for Bob to send that message,
      the firewall can prevent Charlie from sending a message to it. If Charlie
      sends a message to Alice, the firewall looks at the list of destinations
      it’s observed for Alice, not seeing Charlie on that list it “blocks”
      (doesn’t forward) the message.
    </p>
    <h1>Getting through a firewall</h1>
    <p>But what if Alice wants to allow Charlie to send her a message?</p>
    <p>
      If Alice controls the firewall, getting Charlie through is easy! Alice
      just tells the firewall to allow messages from anyone through to her port.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what if Alice doesn’t control the firewall? How can Alice “trick” the
      firewall into allowing Charlie through?
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s actually pretty easy too. Alice can tell the firewall to let
      Charlie through by sending a message to Charlie - once the firewall sees
      Alice send a message to Charlie it’ll let Charlie send messages to Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The astute observer will identify the problem with this: Alice needs to
      know Charlie wants to send her a message in order for Alice to tell the
      firewall to let Charlie through! But Charlie can’t tell Alice that he
      wants to send her a message because that would require Charlie to send
      Alice a message! In order for Charlie to send messages to Alice, Charlie
      needs to be able to send messages to Alice, <b>catch-22</b>
    </p>
    <h1>Side-channel Relay</h1>
    <p>
      Basically, every solution we are going to talk about here (both for
      firewalls and NATs) uses the same mechanism: establish an upfront side
      channel that Alice and Charlie can communicate through to coordinate
      getting a direct connection to each other.
    </p>
    <p>This side channel has to have the following characteristics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be discoverable by both Alice and Charlie</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If Charlie wants to talk to Alice, Charlie needs to know that he needs
          to go through the side channel first.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Be able to send messages to both Alice and Charlie</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The side channel only works if it can send messages directly to both
          Alice and Charlie. Otherwise, we would need a side-channel for our
          side-channel!
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Some approaches will have additional requirements for this side-channel,
      but fundamentally they all rely on relaying messages between Alice and
      Charlie through an existing connection that is already capable of
      communicating with both of them.
    </p>
    <h1>Firewall Rendezvous</h1>
    <p>
      In the above example, if Alice is already talking to Bob, Charlie can ask
      Bob to tell Alice to send a message to Charlie. Once Alice sends Charlie
      that message, the firewall will let Charlie through to Alice. For a
      symmetric firewall, where Alice and Charlie both need to trick their
      firewalls into letting messages through, Charlie and Alice both ask Bob to
      tell each other to send messages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once Alice and Charlie know they need to send each other messages, they
      start sending messages to each other until they start receiving those
      messages. At this point, they’ve breached the firewall and can start
      communicating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using Bob as a Rendezvous point, Alice and Charlie can get through each
      other’s firewalls.
    </p>
    <h1>Sounds easy right?</h1>
    <p>
      Alice and Charlie need to send each other packets through Bob and
      coordinate getting through each other’s firewalls before they can start
      sending each other packets directly. To be explicit, Alice and Charlie
      both have an <code class="inline">(ip, port)</code> that they created and
      are using to communicate with Bob. Bob receives a packet from Charlie’s
      <code class="inline">(ip, port)</code> asking to be connected to Alice.
      Bob then sends a packet to Alice with Charlie’s
      <code class="inline">(ip, port)</code>. Alice then sends a packet to that
      <code class="inline">(ip, port)</code> so she can let Charlie through her
      firewall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The astute observer will notice a pretty challenging problem: this needs
      to happen at a different layer of the OSI Model than most software
      engineers are used to working in. What’s worse is that most libraries for
      networking protocols don’t allow access to that layer.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can’t just “add NAT Traversal” to your SQL or gRPC connection. In
      order to get through a firewall (or NAT), those protocols need to be aware
      of the side-channel relay and handle coordinating and establishing a
      direct connection before trying to send the SQL/gRPC packets.
    </p>
    <aside>
      This was surprising to me! I thought NAT traversal was something you just
      “sprinkled into” an application. No, you have to bake it into the
      communication protocol.
    </aside>
    <h1>Tunneling</h1>
    <p>
      To say that another way: NAT Traversal has to be baked directly into the
      protocol. There are two common approaches to this. The first is to bake it
      directly into the protocol from day one like WebRTC does. This approach
      isn’t viable for most applications. Rebuilding every application layer
      protocol from the ground up to do NAT Traversal would be difficult and
      expensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other approach is to establish a tunnel. The tunnel handles all NAT
      Traversal and exposes a standard OSI-like networking API on top of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, first, Alice and Charlie each start up a tunnel service. Then they
      instruct the tunnel to establish a connection to each other through Bob’s
      rendezvous point. Once Alice and Charlie have a direct connection to each
      other, they can pump another protocol through that tunnel. This lets Alice
      and Charlie use standard libraries and software that don’t support NAT
      traversal.
    </p>
    <h1>"Conclusion"</h1>
    <p>
      So now we have some powerful building blocks for establishing a direction
      communication channel between Alice and Charlie! We need a rendezvous
      point that Alice and Charlie can communicate through, and we need either a
      NAT-Traversal capable protocol or a tunnel that handles NAT-Traversal for
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once those are in place, Alice and Charlie can coordinate allowing each
      other access through their firewalls and everything is solved. Right?
    </p>
    <p>Right? …… Right?</p>

    <h1>The final boss battle</h1>
    <p>
      You know when you make it through a level in a video game and you get to
      that room full of health potions, great armor, a save checkpoint, etc.?
      For a second life is good, you just went through hell and now you’re
      getting pampered by the game developers. Then you realize that can only
      mean one thing: there is an imminent boss battle.
    </p>
    <p>That boss is Network Address Translation.</p>
    <p>
      Most computers do not connect directly to the internet. There is a router
      that connects to the internet. That router creates its own network, a
      subnetwork, that your device connects to. Do you know the saying that
      192.168.1.1 is where the heart is? 192.168.1.* is a subnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Alice connects to Bob, she opens up a port on her computer, but her
      IP address isn’t unique on the internet. Her IP address might be
      192.168.1.123, an address shared by many computers across many subnets. So
      when Alice sends a package from port 23456, her
      <code class="inline">(ip, port)</code> is
      <code class="inline">(192.168.1.123,23456)</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      So then how does Bob know how to get a packet back to Alice? The answer is
      that Bob doesn’t see the packet sent from Alice. Alice’s router changes
      the packet before sending it to Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice’s router opens up its own port, let's say 34567, and replaces
      Alice’s IP address and port with its own. It then keeps track of the
      mapping between Alice’s <code class="inline">(ip, port)</code> and the
      router’s <code class="inline">(ip, port)</code> to reliably forward
      packets back and forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is called Network Address Translation. The router translates packets
      from its subnetwork to the network the router is connected to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob doesn’t know or care about any of this. To Bob, the packet came from
      Alice and Bob sends a packet back to Alice. Alice’s router hides all of
      this happily rewriting and forwarding packets between Alice and Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now we have Network Address Translation. Alice sends a packet to Bob.
      Her router rewrites the packet to come from the router. Bob gets the
      packet and sends a packet back to Alice’s router in response. The router
      then forwards the messages to Alice.
    </p>
    <h1>This is too easy</h1>
    <p>
      So Bob has Alice’s <code class="inline">(ip, port)</code> and is able to
      communicate with her. It’s going through her router and her router is
      hiding all the NAT stuff. Both Alice and her router might have their own
      firewalls, but Bob has already gotten through them.
    </p>
    <p>How does Charlie communicate with Alice now?</p>
    <p>
      All we need to do is follow the same process we used to get through the
      firewall. Bob tells Alice to send a packet to Charlie. Alice sends the
      packet to Charlie. The router rewrites the packet using Network Address
      Translation. Charlie receives the packet from Alice’s router. This opens
      up Alice’s firewall(s) for Charlie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlie can now send a message through to Alice by sending them to the
      router and the router will happily forward them along to Alice.
    </p>
    <p>This boss battle is easy and is called “Easy NAT.”</p>
    <p>
      You might see the looming challenge: if there is an “Easy NAT” then there
      must be a “Not Easy NAT”
    </p>
    <h1>The “Hard NAT”</h1>
    <p>
      “Hard NAT” works the same as above but every destination Alice dials gets
      a random dedicated port on her router. This means the
      <code class="inline">(ip, port)</code> that Bob gets will not be valid for
      Charlie! If Charlie tries to send the router a packet to Bob’s assigned
      port, Alice’s router will drop it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no way for Alice to know which port Charlie should send a packet
      to get through her firewall(s). She can’t know that in advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a lot easier if Charlie has no NAT or firewall. In that case, Bob
      can tell Alice to send a packet to Charlie. When Charlie gets that packet,
      he can send a packet back to Alice and it’ll make it through her NAT and
      firewalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if Charlie is also behind a firewall, he will need to send a packet to
      Alice first to open up a path for her through his firewall. Otherwise,
      Alice’s packet will get blocked. But where should he send the packet?
    </p>
    <p>
      From this point forward, every approach to NAT traversal becomes a
      probabilities game. Alice and Charlie both take a spray-and-pray approach
      sending packets to each other at random ports hoping to “guess” the right
      port number that will punch a hole through the firewalls and NATs between
      the two nodes. They keep guessing until they get through or a timeout
      passes and they give up.
    </p>
    <p>
      That timeout isn’t just for Alice and Charlie, routers often maintain a
      timeout for port mapping where they’ll close the route if a message isn’t
      received. Once you reach that timeout, all of your previous guesses could
      be valid again. If you can’t find the right ports in that window of time,
      you’re unlikely to ever find them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It gets even harder when the firewall has security policies that detect
      port scanning since Alice and Charlie are quite literally being forced to
      port scan each other’s routers. If the security policy kicks in, their
      routers are likely to ban each other’s IP addresses outright.
    </p>
    <h1>The “Dark Souls NAT”</h1>
    <p>
      In this scenario, a NAT traversal strategy is unlikely to succeed. Even if
      the routers’ timeouts are extremely generous and there are no
      port-scanning security policies, it can take many minutes for Alice and
      Charlie to both make a valid matching guess. This latency is beyond what
      most applications can accept.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final boss is a “Hard NAT” router that load balances connections
      across multiple IP addresses. These are common in corporate networks. If
      Alice connects to the internet through a router that has a pool of IP
      addresses, she can’t even be sure what IP address Charlie should try to
      connect to.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Alice tries to send a message to Bob, the router might pick any one
      of the IP addresses from the pool. When she sends a message to Charlie, it
      might come from a different IP address in the pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlie will need to know all possible IP addresses Alice might send a
      packet from and guess the right
      <code class="inline">(IP, port)</code> combination to open up his firewall
      for Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Dark Souls, this is when you shamelessly throw the controller at the TV
      and give up. That’s what we are going to do.
    </p>
    <h1>Giving up and maintaining performance</h1>
    <p>
      When Alice and Charlie are both behind “Easy NATs” and Bob can help them
      coordinate and get through each other’s firewalls, NAT Traversal is quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how do Alice and Charlie know they need NAT traversal in the first
      place?
    </p>
    <p>
      On the internet, there is no “baked-in” confirmation of delivery.
      Confirmation of delivery comes in the form of receiving a response back.
      All you can do is send a packet and wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Waiting isn’t great. If I want to connect two computers, waiting 5 seconds
      to figure out if I need to do NAT traversal is 5 seconds someone is
      staring at a “connecting” screen. And what do we do if NAT traversal isn’t
      easy? Do users sit and wait for 10s+?
    </p>
    <p>
      Can we have our cake and eat it too? Peer-to-peer connections that get
      through firewalls and NAT while still maintaining similar performance to a
      publicly routable centralized service?
    </p>
    <p>Actually, yes. Well, kind of. If Bob is generous.</p>
    <p>
      If Bob is publicly addressable and already providing relaying services to
      Alice and Charlie, that relay can be used both for NAT Traversal and
      communicating.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means Alice and Charlie can start communicating immediately through
      Bob. Bob provides a full relaying service allowing Alice and Charlie to
      communicate even if they can’t talk directly to one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      In parallel, Alice and Charlie try directly dialing each other. If that
      times out, they start NAT traversal. If that fails, they just keep talking
      through Bob forever. But as soon as Alice and Charlie find a way through
      their NAT and firewalls, they “upgrade” their connection to a peer-to-peer
      connection.
    </p>
    <h1>Conclusion (for real this time)</h1>
    <p>
      Getting through a firewall is easy. Getting through an “Easy NAT” is easy.
      Getting through a single “Hard NAT” is tricky, but doable. Getting through
      multiple “Hard NATs” and some corporate network configurations is
      basically impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily most computers can perform NAT traversal fairly easily. “Hard
      NATs” aren’t exceptionally common and it’s even more rare for both ends of
      a connection to be behind a “Hard NAT.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In every NAT Traversal strategy, we need a rendezvous point. To maintain
      performance, and when NAT Traversal fails, we need that rendezvous point
      to act as a relay for all communication.
